# basic-algorithms-javascript

Skeleton code for basic algorithms assignment of "web and sql with python" module

Recommended order of the assignment:

1. Implement a FizzBuzz in the `fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.py`.
1. Implement it in the `fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.html` file in JavaScrip and check it out in the console of your browser.
1. Implement a linear/binary search in the `algorithms/search.py` files.
1. Now that you know how these algorithms work, implement them in JavaScript as well in the `algorithms/search.js` and check it out in the console by opening the html file in the browser.
